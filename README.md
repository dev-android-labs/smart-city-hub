# Smart City Application: High-Level Design (HLD)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a High-Level Design (HLD) for a Smart City application. The aim is to create a centralized platform that provides citizens with real-time information and services related to their urban environment. This HLD outlines the major components, their interactions, and the overall architectural considerations for such an application.

## 2. Overall Architecture

The Smart City application will follow a **microservices-oriented architecture**, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual components. A central **API Gateway** will manage requests from client applications (mobile/web) and route them to the appropriate backend services. Data will be collected from various sources, processed, and stored in a unified data layer.

## Key Architectural Layers:
**Client Layer :** Mobile (iOS/Android) and Web applications for user interaction.

**API Gateway Layer:** Single entry point for all client requests, handling authentication, rate limiting, and request routing.

**Microservices Layer:** Independent services for each functional component.

**Data Ingestion Layer:** Mechanisms to collect data from various internal and external sources.

**Data Storage Layer:** Databases (relational, NoSQL) and Data Lake/Warehouse for persistent storage and analytics.

**Notification Layer:** Push notification and messaging services for alerts.

## 3. Core Components
### 3.1. Weather Service

Description: Provides real-time and forecasted weather conditions for specific city locations.

Data Points: Temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, UV index.

Functionality:

Fetch current weather data.

Provide hourly and daily forecasts.

Support location-based weather information.

Data Sources: Third-party weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, AccuWeather), city-owned weather stations.

### 3.2. Air Quality Index (AQI) Service
Description: Displays current AQI levels and details about pollutants.

Data Points: AQI value, concentration of PM2.5, PM10, O3, CO, SO2, NO2.

Functionality:

Retrieve real-time AQI data for different city zones.

Provide historical AQI data.

Offer health advisories based on AQI levels.

Data Sources: City environmental sensors, national/international AQI monitoring networks.

### 3.3. Traffic Service
Description: Provides real-time traffic conditions, congestion information, and estimated travel times.
